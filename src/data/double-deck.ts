  "A double deck trade show booth, also called a two-story exhibit or double decker, adds a structurally engineered second level above your booth floor, typically used for private meetings, VIP hospitality or a presentation overlook. It needs an island space: 20×20 is the practical minimum, 20×30 and 30×30 are the common sizes, and the deck itself usually covers 40 to 70% of the footprint. Traction X both rents and builds double decks, and manages the part most exhibitors underestimate: stamped structural drawings, venue technical review, fire-marshal occupancy sign-off and egress compliance.";

Once a hall's island space is sold out, or once the price per square foot for a bigger island exceeds what a deck costs to engineer, ship and install, building upward is the cheaper way to add usable area. That calculation flips in your favour fastest at the large, space-constrained flagship shows where the footprint you want simply isn't available at any price.",
      "The second reason has nothing to do with area. A deck puts conversation above the noise floor. Show halls run at 75 to 85 dB during peak hours, which is fine for a demo and hostile to a contract discussion. Eight feet of elevation and a rail is enough to change the acoustics and the psychology, visitors who climb the stairs have self-selected, and they behave like people in a meeting rather than people in an aisle.",
      "The third is visibility. A two-story structure with an illuminated upper band is legible from anywhere in the hall, which is why sponsors and category leaders build them. If the goal is to be the thing people navigate by, height does that more reliably than any graphic at eye level.",

Elevation is not automatically impressive; a badly proportioned deck on an undersized footprint reads as cramped from every aisle.",

Some shows also prohibit them outright regardless of the venue, or gate them behind a sponsorship tier. We check the specific hall and the specific show's exhibitor manual before design begins, not the venue in general, because the answer often differs hall to hall inside the same building.",

export const DD_FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "How much does a double deck trade show booth cost?",
    a: "We quote double decks to spec rather than publishing a starting price, because the spread between a modest deck on a 20×20 and an engineered two-story hospitality structure on a 30×30 is enormous. The cost drivers are: footprint and deck coverage, whether the upper level is open or enclosed, stair versus stair-plus-lift, structural system and finish level, AV and lighting, the show city's labour and drayage rates, and rental versus build-to-own. Send us the show, the space and what needs to happen upstairs and you'll have a real number, not a range, quickly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you rent a double deck, or do you have to buy one?",
    a: "You can rent. Traction X rents double-deck structures and builds them to own, from the same design conversation. Renting is usually the right first move: the structural system is already engineered, which shortens the permit timeline, and you avoid storage, crate maintenance and refurbishment between shows.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the minimum booth size for a double deck?",
    a: "A 20×20 island is the practical minimum, and it's tight, the stair consumes ground-floor space that a 400 sq ft booth can't easily spare. 20×30 and 30×30 are where a deck stops compromising the level below. Second levels are effectively never permitted over in-line or peninsula space; you need island space with all four sides open.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you need an engineer and a permit for a two-story exhibit?",
    a: "Yes, at essentially every major venue. You need structural drawings sealed by an engineer licensed in the show's jurisdiction, submitted to venue technical services and/or the fire marshal, typically 60 to 90 days before move-in, with a plan-review fee and often a floor inspection before the deck can be occupied. Traction X coordinates the engineer, produces and files the package, answers review comments and has a producer on site for the inspection.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does double-deck approval take?",
    a: "Plan on 60 to 90 days between submission and approval at most major North American venues, which is why our double-deck schedule starts about 20 weeks out. The permit, not the fabrication, is the critical path. Shows inside that window are sometimes still possible with a rental structure whose engineering already exists, call rather than email if that's your situation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How tall is a double deck booth?",
    a: "Commonly 16 to 20 feet to the top of the rail, driven by headroom: roughly 8 feet of clearance below the deck and 7 to 8 feet above, plus the thickness of the deck structure. You need about 20 feet of clear ceiling height in the hall for a deck that doesn't feel compressed, and the show's display rules set the hard maximum.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the upper level be an enclosed meeting room?",
    a: "Yes, and it's the most common use. Walls, a door, seating for four to eight, a wall-mounted display and acoustic treatment fit comfortably. Enclosing space, upstairs or underneath, can trigger fire suppression or fire-watch requirements from the venue, which we identify at the feasibility stage rather than after your drawings are sealed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many people can be on the deck at once?",
    a: "The fire marshal assigns a maximum occupancy from the deck area and your egress width, and it has to be posted and enforced during the show. We design to the number you actually need, if you want twenty people upstairs, that requirement shapes the stair count and width from day one rather than being discovered at inspection.",
  },
  {
    q: "What extra costs does the venue charge for a double deck?",
    a: "Beyond our scope, expect: plan-review and permit fees, higher drayage on a substantially heavier shipment, additional electrical for the upper level, rigging if you're hanging signage above it, more install and dismantle hours, and a fire watch where the venue requires one. We estimate all of it and file the forms before you commit, so the total floor cost is visible up front.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a double deck need to be wheelchair accessible?",
    a: "It depends on what the upper level offers. If it provides a service or experience not available at ground level, an accessible route, a lift, or an equivalent ground-floor version of that experience may be required. We flag it during feasibility because a lift changes both the footprint and the budget, and retrofitting one is not practical.",
