        <p>
          Every show has a tail of exhibitors who booked space and then went quiet on the booth itself. They are
          rarely the sponsors, they are the 10×10s and 10×20s, first- and second-year exhibitors, the ones who
          discover in week three that their supplier stopped answering or that a 20-foot hanging sign was never
          going to clear the hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          That tail is what generates move-in day escalations, and it lands on your operations team because there
          is no one else for the exhibitor to call. An official rental program moves that call to us: the exhibitor
          has a published package, a deadline calendar, a project manager and a desk on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also raises the floor on how your show looks. A hall where the small stands are competently built
          photographs better, sells better to next year's prospects, and keeps first-time exhibitors coming back:
          which matters more to renewal rates than almost anything on the sponsorship deck.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not take over your general service contractor's scope. Drayage, material handling, rigging dispatch
          and utilities stay with the GC, and we file through their forms and deadlines like any other
          exhibitor-appointed contractor.
