      "A 20×20 trade show booth is a 400 square foot island with four open sides, the smallest footprint that supports an overhead hanging sign, an enclosed meeting room and a real hospitality zone at the same time. It works with six to ten staff and 15 to 20 concurrent visitors. Traction X rents 20×20 islands from $39,000 and builds them to own from $60,000, with install and dismantle labour inside the price.",

          "Four hundred square feet is the threshold at which a booth becomes a venue. It is the smallest island most shows sell, and the first footprint where the exhibit can host a scheduled programme, meetings on the calendar, demos on a rotation, hospitality between them, rather than react to whoever walks up.",
          "Companies at this size are usually defending or claiming a category position at one or two flagship shows a year. The exhibit budget stops being a marketing line item and starts being measured against pipeline: at 20×20, a show week that produces twenty senior meetings pays for the booth several times over in most B2B categories.",

          "The island format changes the design problem completely. There is no back wall to carry your message, so identity moves overhead and to the vertical elements inside the footprint, a hanging sign, a central tower, or an enclosed room whose exterior walls become your graphic surface.",
          "A 20×20 that tries to be open on all four sides with nothing in the middle looks empty from the aisle. The strongest islands at this size build mass in the centre and keep the corners open for entry.",

        heading: "Layout strategies for a 20×20",
        body: [
          "Centre-mass is the default: an enclosed meeting room or a central tower sits in the middle of the footprint, demo stations and plinths line the perimeter, and all four corners stay open as entries. It gives you brand height, privacy and open access at once, and it is the layout most 20×20 clients end up with.",
          "Quadrant layout divides the footprint into four functional zones, demo, hospitality, meeting, product, each addressing one aisle. It suits exhibitors whose visitors come from clearly different directions or with clearly different needs, and it staffs cleanly with one lead per quadrant.",
          "Open theatre trades the meeting room for a presentation area with eight to ten seats and a large display, and works where the show's value is audience rather than one-to-one conversation. Scheduled 10-minute presentations every 20 to 30 minutes will reliably out-draw an unstructured booth at a busy conference.",
          "Whichever you choose, sightlines matter more here than at any smaller size. A visitor standing in any aisle should be able to see through at least one open corner into activity, an island that reads as a solid block from three sides is a 20×20 performing like a 10×20.",

          "Renting from $39,000 covers a fully custom-configured island with design, fabrication, graphics, freight and supervised install and dismantle. Buying the same design from $60,000 changes the calculation more than at smaller sizes, because island exhibits also carry storage, refurbishment, crate maintenance and a heavier freight profile between shows.",
          "The honest rule: below three island shows a year, rent. At three or more with a stable design, buy, and plan on a graphics refresh every cycle and a structural refurbishment every two to three years. Exhibitors running one flagship island plus several smaller in-line shows are usually best served buying the in-line kit and renting the island.",

    faqs: [
      { q: "Do I need a hanging sign on a 20×20 island?", a: "Practically, yes. On island space with no back wall, the overhead sign is what makes the booth locatable from across a large hall. It also has to be ordered through venue rigging, which your Traction X producer arranges and supervises, rigging labour is billed by the show contractor." },
      { q: "Can a 20×20 booth have a fully enclosed meeting room?", a: "Yes. Roughly 8×10 with seating for four to six, a wall display and acoustic treatment fits comfortably and still leaves room for demos and hospitality. Some shows restrict ceilinged structures or require a fire-marshal review, we check that during design." },
      { q: "How many leads should a 20×20 generate?", a: "It depends entirely on the show and how the booth is staffed and programmed, so we won't quote a number we can't stand behind. What we will do is design the footprint around your target, number of scheduled meetings, demo throughput per hour, and hospitality dwell time, and tell you honestly if the space and staffing plan support it." },
      { q: "What is a 20×20 booth in metres?", a: "6 m × 6 m, about 37 square metres. Many international organizers sell 6m × 6m island space directly, and our 20×20 designs map onto it without redesign." },

  { q: "Do you rent or sell?", a: "Both, from the same catalogue. Every design can be rented for a show or built to own, quoted side by side on the same brief so you can compare the real numbers rather than guess." },
  { q: "Is install and dismantle included?", a: "Yes. Install and dismantle labour is inside every booth price we publish, along with design, fabrication, graphics, warehouse pre-build and freight. Drayage, electrical, rigging, internet and cleaning are ordered from the show contractor and billed by them, we file the forms and estimate the cost before you commit." },
  { q: "How fast can it ship?", a: "Twelve weeks is the comfortable timeline and the cheapest version of any project. Six to ten weeks is standard. We have turned booths around in under four weeks when catalogue inventory and a fabrication slot allow, call rather than email if your show is inside 30 days." },
  { q: "Will I see the booth before it ships?", a: "Yes. Every booth is assembled in our shop two to three weeks before the show and you approve photographs, or a live walkthrough, before anything is crated. Problems get solved on our floor instead of on move-in morning." },
