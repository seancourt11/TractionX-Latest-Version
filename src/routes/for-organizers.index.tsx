  {
    q: "Who are these programs for?",
    a: "Show organizers and event producers, convention centres and venue operators, and associations or societies that run an annual exhibition for their members. Exhibitors are served by the rest of the site, this section is for the people who run the floor.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a partner program cost the show or venue?",
    a: "Nothing. There is no fee to name Traction X as a preferred or official exhibit vendor. The program is funded out of exhibitor orders, and where your organization runs a sponsorship or commission model we support standard revenue share on rental orders placed through the program.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you replace our general service contractor?",
    a: "No. Your GC, Freeman, GES, Shepard, Nüvista or an in-house team, keeps drayage, material handling, rigging dispatch and utilities. We supply custom booth rentals, custom builds, graphics, AV and exhibitor-side install and dismantle, and we file through the GC's forms and deadlines like any other exhibitor-appointed contractor.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are agreements exclusive?",
    a: "Non-exclusive by default. We can go exclusive where your contract structure requires it, and that gets written into the agreement rather than negotiated show by show.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to stand a program up?",
    a: "Four to six weeks from a signed agreement to a live exhibitor order page with rendered packages and pricing. For shows inside 60 days we run an accelerated version, a single-page rate sheet plus a direct order line, and build the full program for the next edition.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do we start?",
    a: `Book a 10-minute call or email ${SITE.email} with your show name, dates, venue and approximate exhibitor count. A complete brief gets acknowledged within one business day and a draft program outline follows within two.`,

            Traction X partners with show organizers, convention centres and associations as an official or preferred
            exhibit vendor. We supply the exhibitor-facing booth program (custom rentals and builds, graphics, AV,
            install and dismantle), run interactive floor plan design and management on whichever platform you use,
            and staff an exhibitor service desk during move-in and show days. There is no fee to the show or venue,
            agreements are non-exclusive by default, and we work alongside your general service contractor rather
            than replacing them. A program takes four to six weeks from signature to a live exhibitor order page.
