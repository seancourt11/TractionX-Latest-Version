      "\"What does a 10×20 booth actually cost?\" is the question we get more than any other, and most suppliers answer it with \"it depends.\"\n\nHere's a real answer. A 10×20 custom rental starts at $17,500. That's structure, printed graphics, lighting, a counter, a monitor mount and install drawings. Buying the same footprint outright starts around $25,000.\n\nWhat moves the number: finish tier, millwork, AV, hanging structure, and the city you're exhibiting in (labour rates in Las Vegas and Chicago are not Halifax rates).\n\nWhat doesn't move it: install and dismantle.

In Las Vegas, material handling sits with Teamsters Local 631 while carpentry and I&D split with IATSE Local 720 depending on the hall and the general service contractor.
