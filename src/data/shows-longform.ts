      `${s.name} is a ${s.cadence.toLowerCase()} ${s.industry.toLowerCase()} event drawing ${s.attendance} attendees to ${s.city}. Traction X delivers turnkey custom booth rentals and full-service exhibits for ${s.shortName}, design, fabrication, freight, AV, and on-site project management, with pricing that ranges from about $16,250 for a 10×10 rental up to hero islands beyond $130,000, depending on materials and scope. Booth space usually opens 10 to 12 months in advance; production sequencing generally starts 12 to 16 weeks before move-in.`,

      `For companies selling into ${s.audience.toLowerCase()}, ${s.name} is the highest-density room your buyers walk in a given year. A single ${month} week in ${s.city} compresses the pipeline motion that would otherwise take six months of outbound, provided your booth actually converts. That is where most ${s.shortName} exhibitors leak spend: a beautiful graphic package that never nudges a stranger into a demo, a floor plan that hides the meeting area, or an AV rig the audience cannot see from 20 feet away. Traction X approaches every ${s.shortName} project as a conversion problem first, then a fabrication problem, the exhibit exists to move badges into meetings and meetings into signed opportunities.`,

    hallStrategy:

      `${venueName} lays out ${s.shortName} across ${v?.halls ?? "several exhibit halls"}. Traffic patterns matter more than absolute floor position, booths near category "anchors," registration ingress, and food & beverage clusters consistently outperform equal-sized booths tucked into perimeter corners. When you engage Traction X early we will read the current floor plan against your goals, flag columns and sightline breaks that would kill your hero graphic, and give you a defensible booth-selection rationale before you sign the space contract.`,
    moveIn:
      override.moveIn ??
      `Move-in for ${s.shortName} typically runs across three to five days ahead of show open, with targeted move-in slots assigned to island booths over roughly 200 square feet. Larger builds (30×40 and up) commonly get earlier windows so structural elements, rigging, and hanging signs can go up before smaller neighbors arrive. Traction X sequences freight to hit your specific target, ship-to-warehouse via the show's advance freight yard whenever possible, because it consistently saves a full day of on-site chaos versus direct-to-show shipments.`,
    moveOut:
      override.moveOut ??
      `Move-out for ${s.shortName} starts within an hour of show close. Empty containers return to the dock in a first-in / last-out sequence, which means a booth that took two days to install can spend eight hours waiting for empties before it can even begin to strike. Traction X keeps a supervisor on site through tear-down, files bills of lading before the final show floor announcement, and re-routes freight back to our warehouse for storage, refurb, or refresh cycles between shows.`,

        {
          q: `When should I start planning our ${s.shortName} booth?`,
          a: `Ideally 6 to 9 months before ${month}. Design typically takes 4 to 6 weeks, fabrication 6 to 10 weeks, and graphics 2 to 3 weeks. Starting earlier gets you better floor position, better labor availability, and advance-pricing rates on show services.`,
        },
        {
          q: `Do you handle freight, drayage, and on-site labor for ${s.shortName}?`,
          a: `Yes. Traction X coordinates freight to the advance warehouse, files material handling forms with the GC, books union or right-to-work labor at ${venueShort}, and a Traction X project manager manages your install and dismantle.`,
        },
        {
          q: `Can we ship our existing booth to ${s.shortName} instead of renting?`,
          a: `Absolutely, Traction X will refresh, refit, or supplement an owned booth. We often propose a hybrid: refresh the hero graphics and hanging sign, rent additional footprint or private meeting rooms for the show, and store everything between events.`,
        },
        {
          q: `How does drayage work at ${s.shortName}?`,
          a: `Drayage is charged by the GC to move your freight from the dock into your booth space and to return empties after the show. It is billed by weight, typically per hundredweight (cwt). Advance-warehouse shipments are usually cheaper per cwt than direct-to-show and cut same-day dock congestion.`,
        },
        {
          q: `What is the difference between a custom rental and a custom purchase for ${s.shortName}?`,
          a: `A custom rental gives you a one-off exhibit designed for this show, then returns to our warehouse, you pay only for the show, and the graphics refresh next year. A custom purchase is asset-owned by you and typically pays back if you exhibit at three or more shows over its lifetime.`,
        },
        {
          q: `Can Traction X manage AV, lighting, and hanging signs for ${s.shortName}?`,
          a: `Yes. AV, rigging, and lighting are usually the highest-visibility elements of a booth; Traction X sources, integrates, and rigs them alongside the exhibit build so you have one accountable partner instead of a stack of separate contractors.`,
        },
        {
          q: `Do you support exhibitors coming from outside the US or Canada?`,
