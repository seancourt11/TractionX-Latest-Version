/** Short, quotable answer block for AI search engines and featured snippets. */
const ANSWER =
  "An interactive trade show floor plan is a live, web-based version of your event's exhibit hall map: every booth is clickable, inventory updates in real time, exhibitors and sponsors can reserve space directly, and attendees can search and navigate the hall on any device. Traction X converts your venue CAD or PDF into that plan in 5 to 10 business days, then runs it, inventory, sponsor fulfillment, exhibitor onboarding and show-day edits, as a managed service. Plan design typically starts around $4,950 per show; fully managed programs start around $14,500 per show.";

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Who are interactive event floor plans built for?",
    a: "Trade show organizers, conference producers, convention and association event teams, expo managers, venues, and general service contractors (GSCs). If you sell exhibit space, fulfill event sponsorships, or manage attendee wayfinding at a trade show, conference, or convention, this is built for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes Traction X different from other floor plan providers?",
    a: "Most floor plan vendors hand you a login and disappear. Traction X combines interactive floor plan technology with a senior services team: AutoCAD-to-interactive conversion, booth and sponsorship inventory strategy, sponsor placement and tier pricing, exhibitor onboarding, payment integration, attendee wayfinding UX, live show-day updates, and integration with your registration and CRM stack. You get the technology AND the team.",
  },
  {
    q: "When in our event planning cycle should we engage?",
    a: "As early as possible, ideally 6 to 12 months before doors open, right when you finalize the venue contract and begin sponsor and exhibitor outreach. Early engagement lets us optimize aisle flow, sponsor real estate, sellable square footage, and tier pricing before you publish a single booth or sponsorship package for sale.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can exhibitors and sponsors buy directly off the floor plan?",
    a: "Yes. The interactive event floor plan is fully transactional, exhibitors and sponsors browse availability in real time, reserve or buy booths and sponsorship packages by credit card 24/7, and self-serve their company profile, logo, products, and lead-magnet materials. Your team stops fielding 'is booth 412 still open?' emails.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle attendee wayfinding on show days?",
    a: "Yes. Attendees access the live event map at a custom URL under your own domain, search exhibitors, sponsors and sessions, get blue-dot directions inside the hall, and bookmark booths to visit, on any device, no app download required.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the trade show floor plan update in real time during the event?",
    a: "Yes. Our team makes live updates during the show, last-minute exhibitor swaps, sponsor takeovers, room changes, session shifts, sold-out indicators, and emergency wayfinding. Changes publish to every attendee device instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it embed into our event website and registration platform?",
    a: "Yes, a single line of embed code drops the interactive floor plan onto your event site, plus native integrations with major event registration platforms (Cvent, Swoogo, RegFox, Bizzabo, Aventri / Stova) so exhibitor, sponsor, and attendee data stays in sync.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you help with event sponsorship fulfillment?",
    a: "Sponsorship is often the largest revenue line at a trade show or conference, and the hardest to fulfill. We map every contracted sponsor benefit (logo placement, premium booth, branded lounges, wayfinding takeovers, push notifications, featured exhibitor cards) onto the interactive plan and produce a sponsor fulfillment report for renewals.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does an interactive trade show floor plan cost?",
    a: "Most organizers land in one of two bands. A designed, branded interactive plan built from your venue CAD, with exhibitor self-onboarding, booth sales and an embed on your event site, typically starts around $4,950 per show. A fully managed program, where Traction X runs inventory strategy, sponsor fulfillment, exhibitor onboarding, live show-day edits and post-show reporting, typically starts around $14,500 per show. Multi-show portfolios are priced across the portfolio. Every quote is confirmed after we see your venue plan and booth count.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we have to switch off ExpoFP, Map Your Show, EXPOCAD or Cvent to work with you?",
    a: "No. Plenty of organizers already own a floor plan platform and simply have nobody to run it. We work as the managed team on top of the platform you already licensed, or we deploy ours if you would rather not carry a licence. Our comparison guide walks through where each major platform fits and where a managed partner adds value.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you know the rules of our venue?",
    a: "We publish a floor plan guide for every major North American venue we work in, hall dimensions and ceiling heights, booth numbering conventions, dock and freight access, rigging approval reality, and the aisle and fire-marshal rules that actually constrain a layout. Those constraints get baked into the plan before it goes to market, not discovered during move-in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can our event floor plan go live?",
    a: "Most interactive event floor plans go live within 5 to 10 business days from receiving your venue CAD or PDF. Rush turnarounds (48 to 72 hours) are available for shows already in market.",

                Every trade show, conference, and convention runs on one thing: the <strong className="text-white">event floor plan</strong>.
                It's how exhibitors decide whether to write the cheque. It's how event sponsors evaluate placement and
                renew year over year. It's how attendees decide what to see, and what to skip. And on too many shows, it's
                still a static PDF emailed around like it's 2008.

                Traction X designs and manages <strong className="text-white">interactive event floor plans</strong> for

                interactive plans on top of whichever platform you already own, or on ours, and wrap it in a senior services
                team: floor plan designers, sponsor strategists, exhibitor onboarding specialists, and on-site project managers
                who are in these halls every week building exhibits.
