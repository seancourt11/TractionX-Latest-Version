  },
  {
    q: "Where are the roles based?",
    a: "Our current open roles are in Vancouver BC, Long Beach CA and Toronto ON. Design, project management, fabrication and sales work out of our shop and office. Install crew work is on the road at convention centres across North America, concentrated in Las Vegas, Orlando, Chicago, New York, Toronto and Vancouver.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much travel is involved?",
    a: "It varies by role. Install crew and some project management roles travel to shows through the spring and fall seasons; fabrication, design and most office roles do not travel regularly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need trade show experience?",
    a: "It helps but isn't required for fabrication, millwork, graphics or AV roles, the underlying trades transfer. Project management and sales roles are much easier with prior exhibit, event or agency production experience.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you take co-op students or apprentices?",
    a: "Yes, in fabrication and design. Send your program, term dates and any portfolio work with your application.",
  },
  {
    q: "I run a company rather than looking for a job, can we work with you?",
    a: "Yes. Fabrication shops, install crews, printers, AV suppliers and freight partners should go to our suppliers page instead of applying here.",

          <p>
            Exhibits are unforgiving: a booth either goes up correctly on a fixed date at a fixed venue, or it
            doesn't. That pressure shapes the team, people who take ownership, communicate early when something's
            off, and care about the difference between a booth that looks right in a render and one that survives a
            four-day show floor.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work across design, fabrication, project management, install and sales, which means people on this
            team see a project from concept sketch through to the crate coming home. If you'd rather own one piece of
            a process start to finish than hand it off and move on, this is that kind of company.
