const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do you build in-house or subcontract the fabrication?",
    a: "Exhibits are built to our drawings and inspected under our QA process, with a full pre-ship set-up before anything crates. You get a photographed record of your booth standing before it ships, whichever fabrication resource the build runs through.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a custom exhibit take to build?",
    a: "Production typically runs six to ten weeks after design approval, on top of roughly one to two weeks of full design development. Rush and rescue builds compress this, we have delivered complete booths in under three weeks, but they carry a rush premium.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I see the booth before it ships?",
    a: "Yes. Every exhibit is fully assembled in-shop and photographed at the pre-ship QA stage, and those photos come to you before crating. That is when changes are cheap; on the show floor they are not.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is install and dismantle included?",
    a: "Yes. Install and dismantle labour is included in Traction X pricing. Drayage, electrical, rigging and other show services are billed by the venue or general contractor, we coordinate them but they are not included in the booth price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the same structure be reused at the next show?",
    a: "That is how we engineer it. Connection hardware is reusable, graphics are a re-skinnable kit, and the asset inventory created at crating carries into storage so the booth can be reconfigured into a different footprint later.",
