const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much does a trade show booth cost?", a: "Rental 10×10s start around $16,250, 10×20s around $22,750 and 20×20s around $39,000. Custom builds run 2 to 3× rental at the same footprint. Show services (drayage, electrical, rigging, cleaning, labor) typically add another 30 to 60% on top." },
  { q: "Do you rent booths or only build custom?", a: "Both. A modular rental program with premium finishes and a bespoke custom shop for one-of-a-kind builds, double-decks, hospitality lounges and sponsor takeovers." },
  { q: "Where can you deliver?", a: "Across the United States and Canada, with a dedicated page for 90+ cities. We also travel with our clients to manage their events globally." },
  { q: "How fast can you turn a project around?", a: "Standard timeline is 6 to 10 weeks. Rush projects under 4 weeks are possible when inventory and fabrication slots allow, including rescue builds when a prior supplier has fallen through." },
  { q: "What's included in a rental?", a: "Structure, printed graphics, standard lighting, one counter or reception station, monitor mount, meeting stool and setup drawings. Freight, drayage and I&D are quoted separately." },
  { q: "What is drayage?", a: "The venue-charged handling fee for moving freight from the loading dock to your booth space and back. It's billed by hundredweight on actual weight, not a fixed fee. We coordinate it but it appears as a separate line on your show bill." },
  { q: "Do you handle union labor?", a: "Yes, full compliance in union jurisdictions (Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, Las Vegas union floors). Certified crews with venue badging arranged in advance." },
  { q: "Can you rescue a project another supplier has dropped?", a: "Yes. Rescue builds are a routine part of our schedule, including sub-4-week turnarounds when catalog inventory supports it." },
  { q: "What about international shipping and customs?", a: "Air and ocean freight to Europe, Latin America, Asia and Oceania. We handle customs paperwork, ATA carnets and harmonised codes, with in-country partners for last-mile drayage." },
  { q: "Do you handle audio-visual too?", a: "Yes, LED walls, 4K displays, PA, lighting, and interactive touchscreens. Rented, installed, tested and supported on-site." },
