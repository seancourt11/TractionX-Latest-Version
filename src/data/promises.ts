Nothing on this page replaces the terms of your signed scope; it describes what those terms say.",

  {
    q: "What is not included in a Traction X booth price?",
    a: "Costs paid directly to the show or venue: drayage/material handling, electrical, rigging, internet, cleaning and any union services the venue mandates. We coordinate and estimate them so there is no surprise, but they are billed by the show contractor, not by us. Everything on our side, design, fabrication, graphics, freight, install and dismantle, is in the quoted scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the scope changes mid-project?",
    a: "You get a written change order stating exactly what changes, what it costs and how it affects the schedule. We do not proceed until you approve it. That is the only way a Traction X project price moves after signature.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast will someone actually get back to me?",
    a: "A designer acknowledges a complete brief within one business day. Preliminary concept direction and an investment range follow within two business days. If your show is inside 30 days, call us, rescue and rush builds are handled the same day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you pre-build rentals as well as custom exhibits?",
    a: "Yes. Custom fabrication and custom rental configurations are both staged and photographed before they ship, because a rental configured for your footprint has the same failure risk as a new build if nobody stands it up first.",
