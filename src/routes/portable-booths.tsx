  "Portable trade show display packages start at $2,000. Most complete portable booth packages range from $5,000 to $15,000, with free 3D design, printed graphics and typical production in 7 to 12 business days.";

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What counts as a portable trade show display?",
    a: "Anything that ships in a case or bag and assembles without tools or a labour call: tension fabric backwalls, pop-up displays, banner stands, portable counters, lightboxes, printed tents, flags and table covers. If two people can set it up in under two hours, it's portable.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a portable trade show booth cost?",
    a: "Portable display packages start at approximately $2,000. Most complete portable booth packages range from $5,000 to $15,000, depending on the footprint, graphics, lighting, counters, storage and AV. Larger 20×20 portable island packages are quoted separately because they include substantially more structure and shipping hardware.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you rent portable displays?",
    a: "No, portable displays are purchase-only. They're priced to be owned: the hardware is reusable show after show and only the graphic is consumable, so buying beats renting on almost any repeat schedule. If you need something for a single event, our custom booth rental program is the right route, that's a separate product line.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a portable display take to produce?",
    a: "Typical production is 7 to 12 business days from artwork approval. Rush production is available on banner stands, table covers and fabric backwalls at a surcharge, send us your show date and we'll confirm the timeline in writing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you design the graphics?",
    a: "Yes. Every order includes print-ready artwork setup and a complimentary 3D visual of your finished display. If you don't have brand-ready artwork, our design team builds it from your logo, product photography and messaging.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can portable displays be reconfigured between shows?",
    a: "Modular and SEG systems can. A 10×20 extrusion wall splits into two 10×10s, lightbox panels restack into different configurations, and counters and towers move between footprints. We flag which of our systems reconfigure before you buy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you ship to shows across Canada and the USA?",
    a: "Yes, direct-to-venue or advance warehouse, with labels and material handling paperwork prepared for you. Drayage and electrical are billed by the venue or general contractor on actual weight and usage, never bundled into our pricing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between SEG fabric and a pop-up display?",
    a: "SEG (silicone edge graphic) frames hold a taut, seamless fabric panel in an extruded aluminium channel, the premium look, and the graphic swaps in minutes. A pop-up uses a magnetic accordion frame with the graphic pre-attached: cheaper and faster to set up, slightly less crisp up close.",
  },
