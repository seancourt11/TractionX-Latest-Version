      "Show organizers who want a purpose-built, visually polished interactive floor plan without a full event-management suite attached.",
    strengths: [
      "Floor plan is the whole product, so the map builder, booth inventory and exhibitor self-service tools are deep rather than bolted on",
      "Exhibitors get an auto-login link to manage their own profile and reserve booths directly on the map",
      "Optional credit card payment collection so booths and sponsorships can be sold straight off the plan",

      "A professional design team option for organizers who want the plan built and styled for them rather than self-serve",
    ],
    considerations: [
      "It's a floor plan tool first, not a full registration, housing or conference-management platform, so larger organizers usually still run those pieces elsewhere",
      "Pricing scales with booth count and event count, which is worth mapping against your show's size before committing",
      "Self-serve plans still need someone to own booth-mix strategy, sponsor placement and exhibitor onboarding day to day",

      "Pricing isn't published; it's quoted per show based on scope, so budgeting requires a sales conversation",

    considerations: [
      "Cvent's diagramming tool is built around general event layouts (banquets, meetings, social events) as much as trade-show-specific booth inventory, so exhibitor/booth-sales workflows are less specialized than floor-plan-first tools",
      "Paid diagramming plans require a 12-month commitment",
      "Full-suite Cvent pricing beyond diagramming is quote-based and can represent a larger platform commitment than a floor plan alone needs",
