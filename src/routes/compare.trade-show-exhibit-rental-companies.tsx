              We're a custom exhibit partner, not a general service contractor and not a systems dealer. Every rental
              we deliver is fabricated to your drawings, your geometry, your finishes, your millwork, then recovered
              and remade for the next client. That means you get a booth that reads as purpose-built for your brand
              without a capital purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Install and dismantle labour is included in the exhibit price rather than appearing later as a surprise.
              Pricing is tiered and à la carte, so we design to your precise budget by trading scope deliberately
              instead of quoting one number and hoping. And before you commit anything, we build a complimentary
              photoreal 3D concept of your space.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/60">
              Where we're not the answer: if you need one invoice covering the whole show floor, or you're running
              general sessions and show-wide production, the official contractor is genuinely simpler. If you need an
              inexpensive pop-up banner shipped this week, a portable dealer will beat us on both price and speed.
