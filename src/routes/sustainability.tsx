const FAQS = [
  { q: "Are rental booths actually more sustainable than owned booths?", a: "Generally yes, because the structure is reused across many clients and shows rather than sitting in storage between two annual appearances or being scrapped after one. The comparison flips only if you exhibit very frequently and genuinely reuse an owned build many times without refabrication." },
  { q: "Can you provide sustainability documentation for our RFP or ESG report?", a: "Yes. On request we provide a per-programme summary covering structure reuse, material specification, graphics substrate and disposition, freight consolidation and lighting load. Tell us the format your procurement team needs." },
  { q: "Do sustainable materials cost more?", a: "Rarely in a rental context. Reusable aluminium and fabric systems are the same materials that make rental economics work, and weight reduction lowers your drayage and freight bills. Where a specific low-impact specification does cost more, we flag it as a line item so you can decide." },
  { q: "What happens to our graphics after the show?", a: "Graphics are brand-specific and cannot be reused by another client. We print on recyclable substrates where performance allows and route them for recycling, or ship them back to you if you want them for a subsequent show or internal use." },

            A custom rental is the lowest-waste way to exhibit at a high standard: the structure is recovered
            and rebuilt rather than scrapped, graphics use recyclable substrates, freight is weight-optimised,
            and lighting is entirely LED. We'll document all of it for your ESG report or RFP response.

            Exhibiting has a footprint. Freight moves, crates are built, people fly. We are not going to call
            a trade show booth carbon neutral, and we are not going to sell you an offset certificate as a
            substitute for reducing what actually gets shipped and thrown away.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we will do is make the two decisions that move the number most: reuse the structure rather
            than build it twice, and ship less weight. Everything else, substrate choice, LED lighting,
            regional sourcing, is real but secondary, and we'll tell you which is which when you ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your procurement team needs specific documentation, tell us what it asks for. We would rather
            answer the actual question than publish a page of ambient green language.
