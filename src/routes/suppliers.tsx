  "Traction X works with fabrication shops, install and dismantle crews, graphics printers, AV suppliers and freight partners across North America. See what we source, our standards, and how to get on our vendor list.";

const CATEGORIES = [
  {
    title: "Fabrication & millwork shops",
    body: "Overflow custom booth fabrication, millwork, welded aluminium and steel frames, CNC, laminate and paint finishing, crating. Most valuable to us near major show markets where trucking a build across a continent makes no sense.",
    need: "Shop drawings read, tolerances held, and crates that survive a fourth show.",
  },
  {
    title: "Install & dismantle crews",
    body: "Supervised I&D labour at convention centres, including union and non-union markets. We schedule to the general service contractor's targets and expect crews on the floor when the dock window opens, not an hour after.",
    need: "Certificates of insurance on file, EAC paperwork filed on time, foreman reachable by phone.",
  },
  {
    title: "Large-format graphics & print",
    body: "Direct-print rigid substrates, tension fabric (SEG) with silicone edge sewn to spec, backlit film, floor vinyl and dye-sublimation textiles. Colour consistency across reprints matters more to us than a slightly lower unit price.",
    need: "Fire-retardancy certificates supplied with every order, proofs before production.",
  },
  {
    title: "AV & technology",
    body: "Display rentals, LED wall supply and technical set-up, touchscreens, media players, sound, lighting and show-day tech support in specific cities.",
    need: "Same-day on-floor swap capability during show hours.",
  },
  {
    title: "Freight & logistics",
    body: "Trade show freight specialists, van lines, cross-border customs brokerage and warehouse partners near major convention markets. Advance warehouse and direct-to-show delivery experience is essential.",
    need: "Guaranteed delivery windows, live tracking, and a human answering during move-in.",
  },
  {
    title: "Specialty trades",
    body: "Rigging engineering, structural stamping, custom lighting, furniture rental, live foliage, flooring, hospitality build-out and specialty finishes for high-end brand activations.",
    need: "Stamped drawings where the venue requires them.",
  },
];

const STANDARDS = [
  {
    title: "Insurance and documentation",
    body: "Current commercial general liability and workers' compensation coverage, with certificates naming the required parties. Venues and general service contractors gate floor access on this, and we cannot fix missing paperwork at the dock.",
  },
  {
    title: "Deadline reality, not deadline optimism",
    body: "We plan builds backwards from move-in. A supplier who tells us early that a date is tight is worth far more than one who agrees to everything and calls the week of the show. Nothing about that conversation is held against you.",
  },
  {
    title: "Compliance with venue rules",
    body: "Fire-retardancy certificates for fabrics and substrates, rigging within the hall's published points and heights, and materials that pass inspection in the specific building, not in general.",
  },
  {
    title: "One named contact",
    body: "A person, with a phone number, who is accountable for our jobs. Shared inboxes do not work during a 6am move-in.",
  },
  {
    title: "Sustainable material options",
    body: "Where you can offer reusable, recyclable or lower-waste alternatives, we want them on the quote, a growing share of our clients specify them.",

    title: "Documentation review",
    body: "We review insurance certificates, licences and any union or EAC status relevant to the markets you work in.",
  },
  {
    title: "A first job, deliberately small",
    body: "New suppliers usually start with a contained scope, one crate, one graphic package, one install, where a problem is recoverable and we can see how you communicate under a real deadline.",
  },
  {
    title: "Rate card and onboarding",
    body: "If the first job goes well, we set standing rates, payment terms and a direct line into our project management team so you're quoted on future work automatically.",
  },
  {
    title: "Ongoing work",
    body: "Suppliers who deliver consistently get first call in their market and visibility of our show calendar ahead of the season, so you can plan capacity rather than react.",

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What regions do you source suppliers in?",
    a: "Across North America, with the heaviest demand in Las Vegas, Orlando, Chicago, New York, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax. We also work with in-region fabrication partners internationally where shipping a build overseas doesn't make sense for the client.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you need suppliers year-round or only in peak season?",
    a: "Year-round, but demand concentrates around the spring and fall show seasons. Suppliers already on our list get visibility of the calendar ahead of those peaks so capacity can be planned rather than scrambled.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are your payment terms?",
    a: "Standard terms are set during onboarding and confirmed on each purchase order. We pay against a PO and a completed scope; we do not hold supplier payment hostage to a client's payment cycle.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be a union contractor?",
    a: "It depends on the market. Several major convention cities require union labour for install and dismantle, and in those markets we need suppliers with the appropriate status. In non-union markets it isn't a requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I supply just one city or one trade?",
    a: "Yes, specialists are often more useful than generalists. A crew that knows one convention centre's docks, freight routes and inspectors is worth more to us there than a national vendor who has never worked the building.",
  },
  {
    q: "We're a manufacturer, not a service supplier. Are you interested?",
    a: "Yes. We source extrusion systems, hardware, lighting, flooring, substrates, textiles and furniture. Send product catalogues and dealer pricing structure along with your capability summary.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I hear back?",
    a: "We acknowledge complete submissions within a few business days. If there's no immediate need in your category or market, we keep the file and come back when there is, that is a genuine outcome, not a polite decline.",
