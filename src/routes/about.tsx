          <p>
            We're a full-service exhibit house. Design and photoreal 3D renders, custom fabrication in wood, metal and aluminium, backlit textile printing, event technology, freight and drayage coordination, and union-jurisdiction install and dismantle, all under one contract with one accountable producer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our clients typically come to us after being burned by the multi-vendor model. Six invoices, three phone numbers, four different people to yell at when something's wrong. We collapse that into one relationship, one project tracker and one number to call.
