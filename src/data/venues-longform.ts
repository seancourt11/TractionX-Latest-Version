      `${v.name} is a ${v.size} convention property in ${v.city}, ${v.stateAbbr}, ${countryLabel}. It hosts ${v.majorShows.slice(0, 4).join(", ")} and other major events. Traction X handles custom booth rentals, freight, drayage coordination, and on-site project management at ${v.shortName}, with pricing that ranges from $16,250 for a 10×10 rental to $130,000+ for hero islands, depending on scope, materials, and AV.`,
    overview:
      override.overview ??
      [
        `${v.name} anchors ${v.city}'s convention economy. The property covers roughly ${v.size} across ${v.halls}, which makes it one of the venues that shapes how the ${countryLabel} tradeshow calendar is booked, anchor shows like ${v.majorShows.slice(0, 2).join(" and ")} rely on the footprint being available in specific weeks each year.`,
        `Because ${v.shortName} operates at the scale it does, exhibitors need to plan against the venue's operating rhythms, not the other way around. That means understanding the loading dock schedule, the exclusive contractor list (electrical, internet, rigging), the labor jurisdictions in play, and the way each hall's ceiling, columns, and hanging points constrain what you can actually build. Traction X spends most of its planning cycle with a client on those constraints before we ever finalize a design.`,
        `Our project managers work ${v.shortName} year-round across ${v.majorShows.length}+ recurring shows, which is the reason we can price accurately, sequence freight without gambling, and put a supervisor on site who has met the venue's shop stewards before. That familiarity compounds, clients who book multiple ${v.shortName} shows through Traction X get faster approvals, better labor allocations, and warehouse storage between shows so freight can stay short-haul instead of coast-to-coast.`,
      ],
    hallStrategy:
      override.hallStrategy ??
      `${v.shortName}'s halls (${v.halls}) each behave differently. Ceiling heights, column grids, and dock proximity vary hall to hall, which means the same 20×20 booth design can succeed in one hall and struggle two halls over. When you engage Traction X during space selection we overlay your booth CAD against the current published floor plan, flag column obstructions in your sightlines, confirm your hanging sign clears the truss, and pick a location whose surrounding neighbors will actually help your traffic.`,
    loadingDocks:
      override.loadingDocks ??
      `Loading at ${v.shortName} runs through the venue's dedicated docks, and inbound freight for large shows almost always sequences through an off-site marshalling yard managed by the show's general contractor (${v.drayage}). For any island booth above 200 sq ft we default to advance-warehouse shipment, inbound to marshalling one to two weeks before show move-in, then targeted to the booth on a scheduled window. Direct-to-show shipments are viable for small in-line booths but risk multi-hour dock waits during peak move-in windows.`,
