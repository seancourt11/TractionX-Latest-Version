const DESC =
  "Traction X is the preferred trade show exhibit vendor for show organizers, convention venues and associations, official rental programs, exhibitor pricing tiers, on-site service desks and revenue share. Apply in one call.";

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What does a Traction X preferred vendor agreement actually include?",
    a: "A branded exhibitor rental program (booth packages priced for your floor plan and rate card), a co-branded landing page and order form, exhibitor service kit content, an on-site Traction X service desk during move-in and show days, and a named project manager who reports to your operations team, not just to exhibitors. Agreements are non-exclusive by default; we can go exclusive where your contract structure requires it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it cost the show or venue anything?",
    a: "No. There is no fee to name Traction X as a preferred or official exhibit vendor. We fund the program out of exhibitor orders. Where your organization runs a sponsorship or commission model, we support standard revenue share on rental orders placed through your program, the terms get written into the agreement, not negotiated show by show.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you replace our general service contractor?",
    a: "No. We work alongside your GC, Freeman, GES, Shepard, Nüvista, or an in-house team. They keep drayage, material handling, rigging dispatch and utilities. We supply custom booth rentals, custom builds, graphics, AV and exhibitor-side install and dismantle, and we file through the GC's forms and deadlines like any other exhibitor-appointed contractor.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can a program be live for an upcoming show?",
    a: "Four to six weeks from a signed agreement to a live exhibitor order page with rendered packages and pricing. For shows inside 60 days we run an accelerated version: a single-page rate sheet plus a direct order line, and we build out the full program for the next edition.",
  },
  {
    q: "What sizes and budgets does the exhibitor program cover?",
    a: "Everything from a 10×10 in-line rental (from $16,250) through 10×20 (from $22,750), 20×20 (from $39,000) and 20×30 (from $65,000) up to six-figure custom islands, double decks and sponsor activations. Install and dismantle labour is included in every price. Venue-billed items like drayage, electrical and rigging are ordered through the GC and billed separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which venues and cities can you service?",
    a: "North America end to end, plus in-region fabrication partners across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Oceania. We work major convention properties year-round, LVCC, Mandalay Bay, McCormick Place, Javits, OCCC, Moscone, Vancouver Convention Centre, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Halifax Convention Centre and more.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if an exhibitor's original supplier falls through?",
    a: "That's the case preferred vendor programs exist for. We hold rental inventory and fabrication capacity in reserve for partner shows and can stand up a rescue booth inside two to three weeks. Your operations team gets one number to call instead of an angry exhibitor with no stand.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do we start the conversation?",
    a: `Book a 10-minute call, or email ${SITE.email} with your show name, dates, venue and approximate exhibitor count. We acknowledge a complete brief within one business day, then send a draft program outline, package tiers, pricing, service desk scope and revenue share, within two business days.`,
