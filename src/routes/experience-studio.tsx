  { q: "Can one program cover trade shows, retail and events?", a: "That's the point of the studio model. A single account team plans your annual calendar across categories so assets, graphics and budgets are reused wherever possible." },
  { q: "How fast can you turn a program around?", a: "Rental refreshes ship in 4 to 6 weeks. Custom builds run 10 to 14 weeks from approved design. Rescue projects are quoted same-day." },
  { q: "Where do you deliver?", a: "Every major show floor in the US and Canada, plus in-region fabrication partners across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Oceania." },
