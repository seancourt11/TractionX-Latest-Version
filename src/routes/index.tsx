const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What does Traction X actually do?",
    a: "Full-service trade show exhibits and brand activations, design, custom fabrication, event tech, freight, install and dismantle. We handle everything under one contract so exhibitors deal with a single vendor.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you rent booths or only build custom?",
    a: "Both. We run a modular rental program (10×10 through 30×40+) with premium finishes, and a bespoke custom shop for one-of-a-kind builds, double-decks, hospitality lounges and sponsor takeovers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a trade show booth cost?",
    a: "Custom booth rentals start around $16,250 for a 10×10 and scale with footprint, 10×20s from about $17,500 and 20×20 islands from about $30,000. Custom-built exhibits start around $12,500 for a 10×10. Every quote includes structure, custom graphics, lighting, install and dismantle; drayage is billed by the venue or general service contractor and shown separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I rent or buy my trade show booth?",
    a: "If you exhibit one to three times a year or your footprint changes show to show, a custom rental gives you design-grade quality with no capital expense or storage. If you exhibit four or more times a year on a consistent footprint, owning a custom exhibit usually wins on cost per show, we design, fabricate, store and refresh it between events. We'll price both paths so you can compare on real numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a 10×10 booth rental cost?",
    a: "A custom 10×10 booth rental starts around $16,250 with Traction X, that covers the structure, custom-printed graphics, lighting, furniture options, shipping coordination, and professional install and dismantle. Larger footprints scale from there: 10×20s from about $17,500 and 20×20 islands from about $30,000.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a trade show exhibit company do?",
    a: "A trade show exhibit company (sometimes called an exhibit house or booth builder) designs, fabricates and manages your presence on the show floor, concept and 3D design, custom fabrication, graphics, event tech, freight logistics, install and dismantle, and on-site project management. Full-service exhibit companies like Traction X handle all of it under one contract, so you deal with a single accountable team instead of six vendors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where can you deliver?",
    a: `Anywhere in the United States and Canada, with venue experience and a dedicated page for ${NA_CITY_COUNT}+ cities, from Las Vegas and Chicago to Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax. We also travel with our clients to manage their events globally.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can you turn a project around?",
    a: "Standard timeline is 6 to 10 weeks from approved design. Rush projects under 4 weeks are possible when inventory and fabrication slots allow, including rescue builds when a prior supplier has fallen through.",

                Our install teams work the major U.S. and Canadian halls week in and
                week out, so they already know the labour rules, dock schedules and
                rigging requirements at the venue you're heading to. Your exhibit is set
                up, inspected and show-ready before you walk the floor, and we handle
                international shows through the same team when your calendar goes abroad.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the core of our philosophy is a commitment to understanding
                each client's unique needs. We prioritize clear communication,
                collaboration and a personalized approach so the final result
                aligns with your brand identity and marketing objectives, from
                first concept through post-event.

                Fabrication is where ideas turn tangible. Our skilled team uses
                cutting-edge equipment and premium materials to bring designs to
                life, visually striking exhibits engineered to survive freight,
                install, and repeat runs at your next show.
