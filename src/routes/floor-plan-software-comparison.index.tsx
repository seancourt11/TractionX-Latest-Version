const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do you sell one of these floor plan platforms?",
    a: "No. Traction X isn't a floor plan software vendor and doesn't compete with these platforms. We're a managed operations partner: we build, populate and run the floor plan for your show on whichever platform you choose (or help you choose one), so your team isn't doing the day-to-day map maintenance in-house.",
  },
  {
    q: "How should we choose a floor plan platform?",
    a: "Start with three questions: how much of your event workflow (registration, booth sales, exhibitor resources) do you want in the same system as the floor plan; whether pricing transparency matters more to you than a fully custom quote; and how much of the ongoing plan management your own team wants to own versus hand off. Floor-plan-first tools like ExpoFP suit organizers who want a standalone, polished map. Trade show operating systems like Map Your Show, EXPOCAD and A2Z Events suit organizers who want booth sales and exhibitor tools bundled in. Enterprise suites like Cvent and ExpoPlatform suit organizers already invested in a wider platform ecosystem.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is pricing for these platforms public?",
    a: "It varies. ExpoFP, Cvent's diagramming tool, MapD Events and ExpoPlatform publish starting prices or tiers online. Map Your Show, EXPOCAD and A2Z Events by Personify quote per organization and don't publish rate cards. We note what's publicly available on each platform's detail page and flag where you'll need a sales conversation to get real numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Traction X run our floor plan on a platform we've already licensed?",
    a: "Yes. Most of our floor plan engagements start with an organizer who already has a platform contract and needs someone to build the plan, structure inventory, onboard exhibitors and keep it accurate through move-in. See our managed floor plan services for detail on that scope.",
  },

            Start with how much of your event workflow you want in one system. Want the floor plan to be a
            standalone, polished, exhibitor-friendly map? Look at floor-plan-first tools like ExpoFP. Want booth
            sales, exhibitor resources and the plan connected in one platform? Look at trade show operating systems
            like Map Your Show, EXPOCAD or A2Z Events by Personify. Already running registration or venue sourcing
            through an enterprise suite? Cvent or ExpoPlatform may extend that investment. Whichever you pick, someone
            still has to build the plan, structure inventory, onboard exhibitors and keep it current, that's the
            part Traction X runs for you.
