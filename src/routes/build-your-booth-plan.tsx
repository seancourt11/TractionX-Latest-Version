  {
    q: "How do I know whether I need a portable, modular or custom trade show booth?",
    a: "It comes down to five things: your booth size, your budget, how much the booth has to do on the floor, how much visual impact you want, and how much of the event you want your exhibit partner to manage. A 10×10 that your own team ships and sets up is a portable kit. A 10×20 with a counter, screens and storage is modular. Anything 20×20 and larger, or anything with meeting rooms, LED, hospitality or double decks, is a custom or modular-plus-custom build with professional install.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the booth planner take?",
    a: "Two to three minutes. The planner only asks the questions that matter for the path you're on, portable exhibitors never see island-booth questions, and the component list arrives pre-selected based on your impact tier and show goals.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to give my email to use it?",
    a: "No. You see your recommended solution, construction approach, booth profile scores and suggested elements without entering anything. Contact details only unlock the investment range and the downloadable plan PDF.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is the estimated investment range?",
    a: "It runs on the same pricing model as our booth cost calculator, footprint, finish tier, scaled add-ons and city tier, with install and dismantle labour included. It's a budgeting range, not a quote. Final pricing is confirmed in writing by a designer once the show, venue and drawings are known.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I plan a booth if I haven't booked my space yet?",
    a: "Yes. Choose \"Not sure yet\" for the space and we'll recommend a footprint based on what you told us the booth needs to do. Most exhibitors who plan before booking end up choosing a different size than they first had in mind.",
