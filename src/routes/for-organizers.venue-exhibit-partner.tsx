      <>
        <p>
          A hall's clear height under the beam is not the same as its clear height at the perimeter. A hanging sign
          needs a rigging point that exists. Fabric needs a certificate. Aisle lines are not negotiable at 6am.
          None of this is obscure, but exhibitors buying a booth online rarely see it until it's a problem on your
          floor, and by then the only people available to solve it are yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with a partner that designs against your specific building removes that category of problem
          before it ships. It also gives your event services team somewhere to send the exhibitor who calls two
          weeks out having realized their stand won't clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          We already publish detailed floor plan guides for major convention properties across North America, hall
          dimensions, clear heights, dock and freight notes, booth numbering and rigging rules. A partner venue gets
          that guide maintained with your input, and gets its exhibitors reading it.
        </p>
