          "If you exhibit at three or fewer shows per year in changing footprints, a modular rental is almost always the right choice. If you exhibit at four or more with a repeatable footprint, a custom build starts paying for itself inside eighteen months, with the added benefit that you own the design.",

          "Choose modular when: you're a first-time exhibitor still learning the show, your booth size changes between shows, your budget is fixed per event, or you're doing a one-off rescue build after another supplier fell through.",

The upfront cost is 2 to 3× a rental of the same size, but by year three the amortised cost per show is materially lower, and the brand experience is one your competitors can't rent.",
          "Choose custom when: you exhibit at four or more shows per year, your booth size and layout are stable, you need permitted double-decks, or the executive team has asked for a booth that doesn't look like anyone else's.",
