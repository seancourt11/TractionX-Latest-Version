      "Global reach, useful when the same programme runs across North America, Europe and the Middle East",
      "Official-contractor advantages on the shows they hold: simpler logistics, direct access to the floor plan and utilities",

    q: "Is install and dismantle labour included, or quoted later?",
    why: "I&D is one of the largest line items on the show floor and is often left out of the headline price.",
  },
  {
    q: "What exactly is billed by the venue or show rather than by you?",
    why: "Material handling, electrical, rigging and cleaning are set by the show, an honest vendor tells you upfront.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a custom build or a system kit with my graphics on it?",
    why: "Both are valid, but they should not be priced the same. Ask to see the structure without graphics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is physically on site during install, and who do I call at 7am on move-in day?",
    why: "A named person beats a support inbox when a crate is late or the floor plan changed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your rush policy and the real cut-off date for changes?",
    why: "Every shop has a point of no return. Knowing it early prevents rush fees you didn't budget for.",
  },
  {
    q: "For rentals, how is the structure refurbished between shows?",
    why: "Rental inventory that isn't refinished shows its age under show lighting.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I see a photoreal 3D render before I commit budget?",
    why: "If a vendor won't show you the booth before you sign, you're buying a description.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if my footprint or booth number changes after the show releases the floor plan?",
    why: "It happens constantly. The answer reveals how flexible the build really is.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the quote structured, one number, or tiers and à la carte?",
    why: "Itemised, tiered pricing lets you protect the budget by trading scope, not by cancelling the booth.",

export const COMPANY_FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "Is Freeman or GES cheaper for a booth rental?",
    a: "Neither is reliably cheaper than the other, their exhibit rental pricing is broadly comparable and both are shaped far more by the show services attached to the booth than by the structure itself. The bigger cost question is whether you're comparing exhibit-only pricing against exhibit-plus-labour-plus-material-handling. Always normalise the quotes to the same inclusions before deciding.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to use the official show contractor for my booth?",
    a: "Almost never for the exhibit itself. Shows require you to order certain services, material handling, rigging, electrical and sometimes labour, through the official contractor, but you are generally free to have your booth designed, built and rented by any exhibit house you choose. Check the exhibitor manual for your specific show, because the rules on install labour vary by venue and jurisdiction.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a general service contractor and an exhibit house?",
    a: "A general service contractor is hired by the show organiser to run the floor: aisle carpet, material handling, rigging, utilities and labour. An exhibit house is hired by you to design and build your booth. The large contractors also sell exhibits, which is where the two roles blur, and why exhibitors sometimes assume they have no choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use my own exhibit house at a Freeman or GES show?",
    a: "Yes. You'll still order material handling and any required services through the official contractor, and your builder submits an EAC (exhibitor-appointed contractor) notice and certificate of insurance where the show requires one. We handle that paperwork as part of every project.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are custom rentals really custom, or just a kit with new graphics?",
    a: "It depends entirely on the vendor. Much of what's marketed as a custom rental is a modular system reconfigured and re-skinned. A true custom rental is fabricated to your drawings, your geometry, your finishes, your millwork, and then recovered and remade after the show. Ask to see the structure without graphics; that answers the question in one image.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I compare quotes from different exhibit companies fairly?",
    a: "Normalise three things: what's included in the exhibit price (structure, graphics, AV, furniture, flooring), whether install and dismantle labour is in or out, and which venue services are excluded because the show bills them directly. Once those three are matched, the quotes are comparable, before that, they usually aren't.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which exhibit company is best for a 20×20 island?",
    a: "At 20×20 you're past what system kits do well and usually below the programme minimums of the largest exhibit houses. That footprint is the sweet spot for a specialist custom-rental partner: bespoke fabrication, a single accountable team, and pricing that doesn't carry enterprise overhead.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is Traction X the wrong choice?",
    a: "If you need a single invoice covering the entire show floor, or you're running general sessions and show-wide production, the official contractor is the simpler call. If you need a $2,000 pop-up banner shipped tomorrow, a portable systems dealer will serve you better than we will. We're the right partner when the booth needs to look purpose-built and the budget needs to be respected exactly.",
