const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How is this different from a traditional millwork shop?",
    a: "We combine a commercial millwork shop with our custom trade show fabrication team. That means we can move faster on brand activations, absorb tight event-driven deadlines, and deliver AV/lighting integration as part of the same scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with architects and general contractors?",
    a: "Yes. We regularly bid off architectural drawings, produce AWI-grade shop drawings, carry commercial insurance and coordinate directly with your GC's superintendent on site.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the minimum project size?",
    a: "Project-based work typically starts around $25,000 CAD. Rollout programs and Millwork-as-a-Service retainers scale from there. We can quote smaller one-off pieces if they sit inside an existing brand relationship.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical project take?",
    a: "A single reception desk or feature wall is usually 4 to 6 weeks from approved drawings to install. Retail rollouts and multi-location programs are scheduled in waves, we lock the schedule at the fixed-quote stage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you match an existing finish or fixture?",
    a: "Yes. Send us a sample, a spec sheet or even a photo and we'll match veneer, laminate, stain and hardware, that's a normal part of rollout and refresh work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle install and freight?",
    a: "Yes, blanket-wrapped freight, site protection, install and punch-list are all included in a turnkey quote. We use our own supervisors and vetted regional install crews.",
