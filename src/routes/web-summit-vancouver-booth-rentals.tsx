const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is Traction X a preferred vendor for Web Summit Vancouver?",
    a: "Yes. Traction X is a preferred booth and activation partner for Web Summit Vancouver exhibitors. We hold a dedicated rental program tailored to the event's footprint at the Vancouver Convention Centre, pre-approved layouts that satisfy Web Summit's rigging and graphics guidelines, and a fulfilment workflow built around the show's move-in windows.",
  },
  {
    q: "What sizes of booths can you build for Web Summit Vancouver?",
    a: "We supply the full range of Web Summit booth packages, Alpha, Beta, Growth, Scale, and the larger Partner / Sponsor activations. That spans 10x10ft and 10x20ft startup pods up to 40x40ft+ partner islands, double-deck builds, hospitality lounges, and full demo theatres.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in your Web Summit rental program?",
    a: "Every Traction X turnkey rental includes concept design, photoreal 3D renderings, structural engineering, SEG fabric graphics, AV (monitors, soundbars, mounts), branded furniture and counters, programmable LED, lead-capture hardware, freight to Vancouver, install & dismantle, and an on-site project manager for all show days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you handle custom fabrication, not just modular rentals?",
    a: "Yes. We run a full in-house fabrication shop, CNC milling, metalwork, paint booth, carpentry, large-format print, and LED/AV integration. For Web Summit Vancouver we routinely mix custom-fabricated hero elements (sculptural lockups, interactive walls, branded bars, demo plinths) with our modular rental system so brands get a one-of-a-kind activation without paying full custom build cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can you turn around a booth for Web Summit?",
    a: "A complete brief receives preliminary concept direction and investment within two business days. Full photoreal concepts, floor plans and a costed BOM typically develop over one to two weeks, followed by a standard 6 to 10 week production timeline from approved design. Rush projects under 4 weeks are possible when inventory and fabrication slots allow, including rescue builds when an original supplier has fallen through.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle shipping, install, and on-site support in Vancouver?",
    a: "Yes, fully turnkey. We coordinate freight into the Vancouver Convention Centre (East or West), file the Material Handling forms with the official show contractor, manage union labour where applicable, run install and dismantle, and keep a dedicated project manager on the floor every show day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the same booth be reused at other events after Web Summit?",
    a: "That's the point of the program. Your Web Summit Vancouver build is engineered as a reusable modular kit, reconfigurable for Collision, Web Summit Lisbon, SaaStr, Money 20/20, Dreamforce, or any future show. We refresh graphics, restock consumables, and ship between events.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do exhibitors get started?",
    a: "Email info@tractionx.ca or use the quote form on this page with your stand number, size, and date of brief. We acknowledge a complete brief within one business day and send preliminary concept direction and investment within two business days, no sales call required to see pricing. Full photoreal design and a costed BOM follow in roughly one to two weeks as the scope develops. Early bird: book before September 1 and we'll apply a 7.5% discount on the project before peak season hits.",
