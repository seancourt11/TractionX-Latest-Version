    q: "How fast can you turn around a booth?",
    a: "A designer sends preliminary concept direction and investment within two business days of a complete brief. Full photoreal concepts, production planning and a costed BOM typically develop over one to two weeks, followed by a 6 to 10 week custom build from approved drawings. Rush timelines are possible; a rush fee may apply inside 30 days and can sometimes be waived by a project manager.",

          Most exhibit problems happen at the handoffs, designer to fabricator, fabricator to freight, freight to labour
          crew. Running the whole chain in-house removes those seams: the team that drew the booth is the team that
          builds it, crates it, ships it and sets it on the floor. That's why our pricing includes install and dismantle
          labour, and why the drayage bill gets audited by the same producer who booked the freight.
