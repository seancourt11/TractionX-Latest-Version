      <>
        <p>
          Walk any move-in and the questions arriving at the organizer's office are overwhelmingly booth questions:
          where is my crate, can I hang this, my graphic is torn, my supplier isn't answering, who do I pay for
          labour. None of those need a decision from show management, they need someone with a truck, a crew and
          the GC's phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
          A service desk exists to intercept that traffic. It also produces something your team currently has to
          assemble by hand: an accurate, real-time picture of which stands are actually going to be ready when the
          hall opens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desk is not a replacement for your general service contractor's exhibitor services counter. The GC
          keeps drayage, material handling, rigging dispatch and utilities; we cover the booth itself, structure,
          graphics, AV, install and dismantle, and route anything else to the right counter instead of back to you.
        </p>
