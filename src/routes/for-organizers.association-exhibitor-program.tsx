        <p>
          At a commercial trade show, a disappointing exhibiting experience costs one booth sale. At an association
          meeting it costs a booth sale and strains a membership relationship, often with a smaller organization
          whose entire marketing budget went into that one stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common failure is not price, it's the gap between tiers. A member who can't stretch to the
          sponsor package ends up with a table and a pull-up banner, looks out of place next to the industry
          players, gets few conversations, and quietly doesn't return the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
          A properly structured tier set fixes that. The entry tier has to be a real booth, built, lit, and
          designed to the same visual language as the rest of the hall, just smaller. Then upgrading feels like a
          logical step rather than a leap into a different category of spend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Install and dismantle labour is included in every package price, which matters disproportionately for
          small member exhibitors: it's the cost that most often surprises them and sours the experience.
