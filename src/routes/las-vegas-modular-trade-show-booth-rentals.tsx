const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does a custom trade show booth rental cost in Las Vegas?",
    a: "Custom modular trade show booth rentals in Las Vegas start at $16,250 for a 10×10, $22,750 for a 10×20, and $39,000 for a 20×20 island. Fully custom builds and larger islands are quoted to spec. Every package includes design, 3D renderings, SEG fabric graphics, I&D labor, and an on-site project manager. Drayage is billed separately by the venue/GSC. We send preliminary concept direction and investment within two business days so you can see how the project is shaping up.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which Las Vegas venues do you service?",
    a: "Traction X delivers, installs, and dismantles at every major Las Vegas venue including the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) West, Central and North Halls, Mandalay Bay Convention Center, Caesars Forum, The Venetian Expo (Sands), Wynn, MGM Grand Conference Center, Resorts World, and the Westgate. We hold relationships with the union labor pools and the official general service contractors for each hall.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far in advance should I book a Las Vegas booth rental?",
    a: "For major shows like CES, NAB, SEMA, MAGIC, ConExpo, IMEX, and HIMSS we recommend booking 12 to 16 weeks out. For mid-sized shows, 6 to 10 weeks is comfortable. We accept rush projects under 4 weeks when inventory allows and frequently rescue exhibitors whose original supplier dropped the ball.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do modular rentals look as good as custom builds?",
    a: "Yes. Our modular systems use aluminum extrusion frames with tension-fabric SEG graphics, backlit lightboxes, real wood-laminate counters, programmable LED, and integrated AV. Side by side, a well-designed modular rental is visually indistinguishable from a custom build, at 40 to 60% of the cost and with reusable components for your next show.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle I&D labor, show services, and freight in Las Vegas?",
    a: "Yes. We coordinate freight to the advance warehouse or show site, union I&D labor, electrical and rigging orders, AV setup, on-site supervision during show days, dismantle, and return logistics. Drayage is billed directly by the venue or GSC; we file the paperwork and manage it so you don't have to. You get one project manager and one invoice for everything we deliver.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the same booth be reconfigured for shows in other cities?",
    a: "That is the core advantage of modular. Your 20x20 island in Las Vegas can be reconfigured as a 10x20 inline for your next regional show, or scaled up to a 30x30 with added kit. We store, refresh graphics, and ship it for you between events.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your turnaround on a quote?",
    a: "We acknowledge complete briefs within one business day and send preliminary concept direction and investment within two business days. Full photoreal booth renderings, floor plans and a costed BOM follow over roughly one to two weeks as the scope develops. No call required to get started.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide on-site support during the show?",
    a: "Yes. A dedicated Traction X project manager is on the floor every day of your event, handling anything from a burned-out lightbox to a last-minute graphic swap so your team can focus on leads.",

              Las Vegas is the most competitive trade show city on earth.
              Your booth needs to earn the walk-up.

            <div className="space-y-5 text-white/75 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-light">
              <p>
                Every year, Las Vegas hosts more than <strong className="text-white">22,000 conventions</strong> and
                draws over <strong className="text-white">six million business
                travelers</strong>. The Las Vegas Convention Center alone moves
                more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibit space across CES,
                SEMA, NAB, ConExpo, and World of Concrete. If you are exhibiting
                here, you are sharing the aisle with brands that spend
                seven figures on their floor presence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traction X does both. We design and fabricate <strong className="text-white">fully custom trade show booths</strong> built from scratch for one-of-a-kind flagship activations, and we run a <strong className="text-white">custom modular rental program</strong> that delivers the same visual impact with reusable, reconfigurable systems. Aluminum extrusion frames, tension-fabric SEG graphics, integrated AV, programmable LED, and real wood-laminate finishes. Nothing about it looks "rented."
              </p>
              <p>
                We are the team brands call when they need a one-time custom build, when they want a rental program that scales across multiple cities, or when their original supplier missed a deadline three weeks out. One project manager, one phone number, and one invoice covering design, fabrication, freight, I&D, AV, and dismantle.

              A custom modular trade show booth rental in Las Vegas is a bespoke exhibit
              engineered from reusable aluminum-extrusion framing, tension-fabric SEG
              graphics, integrated LED and AV, and premium finishes, designed for one
              exhibitor, then reconfigured or scaled between shows. It is the right choice
              when you want custom-booth impact with rental economics and multi-show flexibility.
              Traction X also designs and fabricates fully custom, one-of-a-kind builds for
              flagship activations that demand a unique structure.

          <p>
            A <strong className="text-white">fully custom build</strong> is the right call when you need a one-of-a-kind
            flagship activation, unique architecture, special materials, or a hero moment that
            will never be repeated. Traction X designs and fabricates these builds from scratch
            for clients who demand something entirely their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong className="text-white">custom modular rental</strong> is the smart choice when you want the same
            visual quality and a faster, more flexible program. Our systems are engineered with
            aircraft-grade aluminum extrusion, magnet-locked SEG fabric panels, integrated LED
            arrays, real wood-laminate counters, and structural tolerances that pass every
            venue's fire marshal review, including the Las Vegas Convention Center's strict
            combustible-load rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the kit is reconfigurable, your investment compounds. The 20x20 island that
            anchored your CES presence becomes a 10x20 inline at your regional roadshow, then
            scales back up to a 30x30 for HIMSS in the spring. New graphics, same skeleton.
            Your CFO will understand the math instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            And because Traction X handles storage, graphic refresh, freight, I&D, and on-site PM
            under one roof, you are not chasing five vendors across three time zones the week of
            your show. You are at your booth, talking to qualified leads, whether you chose a
            custom build or a custom rental.

              Summer dock temperatures push 115°F. We use UV-stable SEG
              fabric, sealed crates, and climate-controlled storage so
              graphics arrive show-ready instead of warped. Winter trade
              shows benefit from our covered staging in North Las Vegas.

              We coordinate booth-staff hotel blocks at Resorts World, Westgate,

              Mandalay Bay; and Venetian/Palazzo towers for Sands shows.
