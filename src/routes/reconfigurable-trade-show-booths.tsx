  "A reconfigurable trade show booth re-frames from 10×10 to 10×20 to 20×20 between shows, same inventory, new layout. Rent from $16,250 or build from $12,500.";
const SHORT_ANSWER =
  "A reconfigurable trade show booth is a modular exhibit engineered to be taken apart and rebuilt in different sizes and layouts between shows. The same frame, counters and graphics that made a 10×10 inline re-combine into a 10×20 endcap or a 20×20 island, you add or remove sections instead of ordering a new booth each year.";

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a reconfigurable trade show booth?",
    a: SHORT_ANSWER,
  },
  {
    q: "Is reconfigurable the same as modular?",
    a: "Modular describes how the booth is built, aluminium extrusion framing with interchangeable sections instead of one-off wood construction. Reconfigurable describes what you can do with it: change the footprint, the shape and the component layout from show to show. Most modular booths are reconfigurable to a degree; the difference is whether the system was actually engineered and drawn for multiple layouts, which is how we spec every reconfigurable program at Traction X.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a reconfigurable booth change size between shows?",
    a: "Yes. A single inventory of framing, SEG fabric and casework spans a 10×10 (3×3 m), a 10×20 (3×6 m) and a 20×20 (6×6 m). When the next show gives you more or less floor space, we add or remove sections and re-cut SEG graphics to the new walls, the core structure, counters and storage carry over unchanged.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a reconfigurable trade show booth cost?",
    a: "Reconfigurable rentals start at $16,250 for a 10×10, $22,750 for a 10×20 and $39,000 for a 20×20. If you'd rather own the system, custom-built reconfigurable exhibits start at $12,500 for a 10×10. Anything you see online is a starting range only, send us your show, footprint and dates and you get a real number within two business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I rent or buy a reconfigurable exhibit?",
    a: "Renting suits one-off shows, first-time exhibitors and multi-city programs where you don't want to store, refurbish or re-permit anything between events. Owning pays off when your program repeats in the same footprint most of the year and you want the same booth re-graphed rather than re-rented. We build both, and our rent-vs-buy comparison walks the full math.",
