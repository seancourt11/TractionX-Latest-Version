It is billed by hundredweight on actual crated weight with a minimum, and it is separate from shipping." },
      { q: "How much does drayage cost?", a: "Rates commonly run $85 to $180 per hundredweight depending on the city and venue, with a 200 to 300 lb minimum per shipment and surcharges for overtime, uncrated goods and special handling. A typical 10×20 exhibit generates $1,500 to $4,500 in drayage round trip." },
      { q: "Can I set up my own trade show booth?", a: "In many venues yes, if the booth is under a size threshold (often 300 sq ft), the work is done by full-time company employees using hand tools only, and nothing involves house power or overhead rigging. In strict union jurisdictions such as Chicago, New York and San Francisco the exceptions are narrower, check the exhibitor manual for that specific show." },
      { q: "How do I reduce drayage charges?", a: "Consolidate everything onto one shipment, crate to weight rather than to habit, ship to the advance warehouse instead of direct-to-show, source literature and giveaways locally, and choose a modular structure over heavy solid construction where the finish allows." },
      { q: "Is drayage included in a Traction X booth quote?", a: "No. We coordinate and optimise it, but drayage is billed directly by the venue's official contractor on your show bill. We tell you what to budget for it up front so it isn't a surprise." },
