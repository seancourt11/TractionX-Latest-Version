const TITLE = "Rescue Booth Builds, Last-Minute Trade Show Exhibits | Traction X";
const DESC =
  "Supplier fell through or your show moved up? Traction X delivers rescue trade show booth builds in as little as 45 days, with install and dismantle included across the US and Canada.";

const ANSWER =
  "A rescue build is a complete custom exhibit delivered on a compressed timeline, typically 45 days, and in emergencies less, after another supplier failed, a design was rejected, or a show date moved. Traction X takes the space contract and whatever assets exist, re-engineers around what is actually buildable in the time left, and installs it. Rush work carries a premium, but a project manager can waive part of it depending on the show, the size, and the shop calendar.";

const SITUATIONS = [
  {
    t: "Your supplier went quiet",
    b: "Deposits paid, drawings never came, and nobody is answering. We start from your space contract and exhibitor kit rather than waiting for files that may never arrive.",
  },
  {
    t: "The design got rejected",
    b: "Show management or the venue flagged a height, hanging sign, or fire-rating issue. We re-engineer to the actual rules in the exhibitor manual and resubmit.",
  },
  {
    t: "Your show moved up",
    b: "A schedule change, a last-minute upgrade to a larger footprint, or a sponsorship that came through late. We scope to the footprint you now hold.",
  },
  {
    t: "The crates arrived damaged",
    b: "Freight damage, missing hardware, or graphics that no longer match the brand. We rebuild the failed elements and reprint the graphics package.",
  },
  {
    t: "You inherited someone else's booth",
    b: "A booth from a previous team or agency with no drawings and no manual. We inventory it, document it, and make it standable again.",
  },
  {
    t: "You have no exhibit at all",
    b: "The decision to exhibit came late. Custom rental structure plus a fresh graphic package is the fastest credible route to a floor-ready booth.",
  },
];

const TIMELINE = [
  { d: "Day 0", t: "Triage call", b: "A 10-minute call covering footprint, show, venue, deadline and what assets exist. You leave the call knowing whether the date is achievable." },
  { d: "Day 1", t: "Feasibility and range", b: "We confirm what is buildable in the time left and give you a starting range plus any rush premium in writing. No obligation to proceed." },
  { d: "Day 2 to 4", t: "Concept", b: "A preliminary 3D concept built around proven structure, the elements we can guarantee in the window rather than what looks best in a render." },
  { d: "Day 5 to 10", t: "Approval and engineering", b: "Design sign-off, production drawings, graphics files and venue submissions all move in parallel instead of in sequence." },
  { d: "Day 10 to 35", t: "Fabrication", b: "Millwork, structure and graphics in production, with a pre-ship set-up and photographed QA before crating." },
  { d: "Day 35 to 45", t: "Ship and install", b: "Crates routed to the advance warehouse or direct to show site, install and dismantle labour included, project manager on the floor." },
];

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the fastest you can deliver a booth?",
    a: "Forty-five days is our standard rescue window for a full custom build. Tighter than that is possible with custom rental structure and a fresh graphic package, we have delivered floor-ready booths in under three weeks, but the design has to bend toward proven components.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much more does a rush build cost?",
    a: "Rush work inside 30 days carries a 30% premium on the booth. A project manager can waive part or all of it depending on the show, the footprint and where the shop calendar sits, ask, because it is frequently negotiable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work with the design my previous supplier produced?",
    a: "Often yes, if the drawings are complete enough to build from and the design is achievable in the time left. If not, we reuse the intent and re-engineer the structure. Either way you own the outcome, not the leftover paperwork.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle the venue paperwork too?",
    a: "Yes. Exhibitor kit deadlines, hanging sign approvals, electrical and rigging orders, and general contractor coordination are all part of project management. Missing a discount deadline is one of the most common, and most expensive, rescue costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which cities can you rescue a build in?",
    a: "Across the United States and Canada. Las Vegas, Orlando, Chicago, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax move fastest because of shipping lanes and labour relationships, but we install nationwide.",
  },

            <p className="mt-3 text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              Builds inside 30 days carry a 30% premium. It pays for shop resequencing, expedited
              print and freight that cannot wait for a consolidated truck. It is a real cost, not a
              penalty for panicking.

              A project manager can waive part or all of it, most often on larger footprints, on
              shows where we already have crews and freight moving, or when the shop calendar has
              room. Ask before you assume the number is fixed.

                Promise a date the shop calendar can't hold. If it isn't buildable, you hear that on
                the first call, while you still have other options.

                Skip the pre-ship set-up. Rescue builds get assembled and photographed before crating
                like every other exhibit, the compressed ones need it most.

                Hide show-service costs. Drayage, electrical and rigging are billed by the venue; we
                coordinate and forecast them, but they are never buried in the booth price.
