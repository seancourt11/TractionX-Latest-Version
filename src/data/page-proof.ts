 * available (a first-hand note after a show, a photo set, a verified spec) and
 * the page picks it up automatically.
 *
 * Why it matters: Google's March 2026 core + spam updates target "scaled
 * content abuse" — sets of pages where only the entity name changes. The fix
 * is information gain: something on this page that exists on no other page.
 * Facts below should be verifiable; first-hand notes should be things Traction
 * X actually experienced.
